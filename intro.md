# ANMBS1 - Fluid Water Transport in Porous Media

This Jupyter Book was created for the course Advanced Numerical Methods in 
Building Science 1 (207.014) at TU Wien during Summer 2022.

In this document, water transport in porous media is being discussed by numerically solving a 
one dimensional initial and boundary value problem.
The modeling is done according to {cite}`A7` and validated by comparing with {cite}`A4`.
