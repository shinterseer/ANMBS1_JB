# Fluid Water Transport in Porous Media

This Jupyter Book was created for the course Advanced Numerical Methods in 
Building Science 1 (207.014) at TU Wien during Summer 2022.

In this document, water transport in porous media is being discussed by numerically solving a 
one dimensional initial and boundary value problem.
The modeling is done according to {cite}`A7` and validated by comparing with {cite}`A4`.

## Problem Description
A specimen of a certain length and cross sectional area is exposed to moisture levels at both ends. 
Over time, certain moisture levels will manifest inside the specimen depending on:
* initial condition
* boundary conditions
* material properties

This allows to simulate experiments like imbibition and drying of a specimen of a certain material.
