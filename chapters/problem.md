# Problem Description

A specimen of a certain length and cross sectional area is exposed to moisture levels at both ends. 
Over time, certain moisture levels will manifest inside the specimen depending on:
* initial condition
* boundary conditions
* material properties

Like this experiments like imbibition and drying can be simulated.
